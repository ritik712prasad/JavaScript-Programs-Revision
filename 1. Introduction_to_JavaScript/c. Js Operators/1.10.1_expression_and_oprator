----What is Expression?
_____________________________________
-an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
-Expression in programming is a combination of one or more values, 
variables, operators, and functions that, when evaluated, produces
a single value. Expressions can be simple or complex,
 but they are always something that results in a value.

 5 + 3       // Results in the value 8
x * 10      // If 'x' is a variable, this represents a value based on the current value of 'x'
Math.sqrt(25)  // Results in the value 5
let result = 5 + 3;  // The expression (5 + 3) resolves to the value 8, which is then assigned to the variable 'result'.


----what is Operator?
_____________________________________
an operator is a symbol or keyword that performs 
operations on one or more operands.
  (Operands can be values, variables, or expressions,
        and the result of an operation is a new value.)
  
  --example--
                             5 + value1

        In this, expression '5' and 'value1' are operands
                       and  '+' is operator.
