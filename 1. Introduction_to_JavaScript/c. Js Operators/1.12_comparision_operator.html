        Comparison operators
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.
 The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
 Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.
  In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. 
  This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons. 
  These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before checking equality.
  following are comparison operators :-

  1. equal( == )                returns true if the operands are equal 
  2. not equal( != )            returns true if the operands are not equal.
  3. strict equal( === )        returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. means compairs data and its type both.
  4. strict notequal( !== )     returns true if the operands are not equal and are of different type. means compairs data and its type both.
  5. greater than( > )          returns true if the left operand is greater than to the right operand.
  6. greater than or equal( >= )returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
  7. less than( < )             returns true if the left operand is less than to the right operand.
  8. less than or equal( <= )   returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
