--------What is Variable?
-------------------------

A variable is a container for a value, 
like a number we might use in a sum, 
or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
--------------
variable  refers to a named storage location used to store data in a computer program. 

example---
        2002 represents a data value stored in a memory location within a computer's storage.
         To manage and access this data, we create variables, assigning them names. 
         These names serve as references to the stored data, allowing for easier manipulation within a program.

-------------------------------------
--------Variables in JavaScript.
-------------------------------------
In JavaScript, var, let, and const are keywords used for variable declaration, 
each serving specific purposes within the language.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means we don't need to explicitly specify the data type of a variable.

example---
      var a=5;   also see in program. 1.6

      var - use for declaring amd making variable
      a - variable name
      5 - assinged data value

--------Facts about JS variable.
-------------------------------------

=> JS variables are case sensitive.
    - means art ans Art both are different.

=> Variable names can only contain letters 
     -(a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), or dollar signs ($).
     -They cannot start with a digit.
     - we can't use reserved word as variable name.
     - when we don't assign any value to variable, then its value is undefined.

     - tips -- Don't use underscores at the start of variable names.
            -- Use camelCaseNotation.
