we can see all output in our learning journay with the help of

 console.log()

            This is a method in JavaScript that allows you to log information to the console.
            The console is a tool available in web browsers for developers 
            to display messages, errors, and other information while working on a web page.

            let message = "Hello, World!";
            console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, World!

 document.write()
            
            This method is used to write content directly to the HTML document. 
            It can be useful for testing or simple demonstrations, 
            but it's not commonly used in modern web development
            due to its limitations and potential impact on the structure of the document.

        @------note---- if our js code has any error it will not display any type of js code output.






        In addition to `console.log()` and `document.write()`, there are several other ways to log output and debug your code during your learning journey in JavaScript. Here are some commonly used techniques:

1. **Alert:**
   - we can use the `alert()` function to display a dialog box with a message. This is a simple way to provide feedback to the user or debug your code.

    ```javascript
    alert("Hello, World!");
    ```

2. **Comments:**
   - Adding comments to your code is a non-intrusive way to leave notes for yourself or others. You can use comments to explain the purpose of certain code sections.

    ```javascript
    // This is a comment
    ```

3. **Debugger Statement:**
   - The `debugger` statement can be used to initiate a debugging session when the developer tools are open. It stops the execution of JavaScript code and allows you to step through it.

    ```javascript
    function example() {
        debugger;
        // Code to be inspected
    }
    ```

4. **Console Methods:**
   - Besides `log()`, the `console` object has other useful methods, such as `error()`, `warn()`, and `info()`. These help differentiate the types of messages you output.

    ```javascript
    console.error("This is an error message.");
    console.warn("This is a warning message.");
    console.info("This is an informational message.");
    ```

5. **Using `console.table()`:**
   - For arrays and objects, `console.table()` can present the data in a tabular format, which can be helpful for visualizing structured information.

    ```javascript
    let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
    console.table(fruits);
    ```

6. **Grouping in the Console:**
   - `console.group()` and `console.groupEnd()` allow you to group related log statements together in the console.

    ```javascript
    console.group("Grouped Logs");
    console.log("Log 1");
    console.log("Log 2");
    console.groupEnd();
    ```

These techniques provide various ways to inspect and debug your JavaScript code as you progress in your learning journey. Depending on the situation, you can choose the method that best fits your needs.
